# [Variables and Data Types](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/315/9299/62836)

## Learning Objectives:

- Introduction to __data types__
- Introduction to __primitive types__ versus __object types__

## terms

- data type
- primitive types
- object (reference) types

## Type Declarations

Java requires that the type of data stored in a variable (or returned from a method) be specified when the variable is declared (or the method is defined).

- valid Python code:

```python
name = "Monty"
```
- But, it is invalid Java code!

### Java primitive data types

- `byte`
- `short`
- `int`
- `long`
- `float`
- `double`
- `boolean`
- `char`

### Java object (reference) types

- anything that is not a primitive type
- start with a capital letter
