- Have all the necessary tools to create an application that makes use of MySQL




> You may ask why we bother with a service layer when we could simply use the repository in our controller. The purpose of the service layer is to perform any business logic before using the repository to perform queries. In short, layering provides separation of concerns. The value of separating concerns becomes more apparent as our applications grow.
