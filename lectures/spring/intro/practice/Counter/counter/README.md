## Learning Objectives:

- Practice using __session__ to store data about a particular client's history with the app
- Be able to check whether a __session__ variable exists
- Use dependency injection to initialize __session__
- Use getAttribute and setAttribute to read and modify __session__


## Steps

Create and display a counter on http://localhost:8080/counter.

Increment the counter on each visit to http://localhost:8080.

The counter must start at zero.

There should be no errors regardless of which page is visited first.

Ninja Bonus 1: Create a third page that increments the counter by 2.

Ninja Bonus 2: Create a reset button to set the counter back to zero.
