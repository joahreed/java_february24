# [Devices](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/315/9381/64443)

## Learning Objective:

- Implement inheritance


## Steps:

- [ ] Create a [Device](./end/src/main/java/tylermaxwell/Device.java) class with a battery attribute and status method.

- [ ] Create a [Phone](./end/src/main/java/tylermaxwell/Phone.java) class that extends the Device class and has the following three methods: makeCall, playGame, and charge.

- [ ] Create a ['DeviceTest'](./end/src/main/java/tylermaxwell/Main.java) test class and instantiate the Phone class.

- [ ] Call the makeCall method three times, the playGame method twice, and the charge method once.

- [ ] Ninja Bonus 1: Add a 'battery critical' message to your Phone class that is displayed when the battery falls below 10.

- [ ] Ninja Bonus 2: Don't allow the user to play a game if the battery life is below 25.
