# [Four Pillars]()

## Learning Objective:

- Learn the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

## APIE = Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation

### Encapsulation

>Encapsulation in Java involves controlling access to properties or methods with __access modifiers__ and limiting control to the inner scope where necessary. 

### Inheritance

>Inheritance is the idea that we pass along __attributes__ and __methods__ from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work. Child classes can be more specific versions of their Parent class. Using the keyword `super` will call methods from the Parent class.
### Polymorphism

>Polymorphism means "many forms", and the idea in OOP is that a Child class can have a different version of a method than the Parent class. 

### Abstraction

>Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation. It allows us to hide attributes or methods Other classes [don't need to know].
